    This was not one of the challenges made to me.
    In particular it hasn't been tested against 
    the secret test cases.
    
    Given the transition probabilities matrix m
    of a random walk on a graph, this function computes 
    the absorbing probabilities. This is, the probabilities 
    to reach the absorving nodes.

    The matrix is assumed to be of non-negative integer 
    entries. The probabilities are the entries divided by
    the sum of the elements of the corresponding row.

    The initial state corresponds to the first row.

    The output is a list contaning first all the numerators
    of the probabilities of the absorving nodes, and the last
    entry is the common denominator.
