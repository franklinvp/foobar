def maximum_flow_on_graph(entrances, exits, path):
    """
    This challenge was essentially, up to some formulation with
    bunnies and stuff, computing maximum flow on a graph with possibly 
    several entrances and several exits. In the problem they said that the maximum
    flow was going to be not larger than 2000000, which is a bit large.
    So, probably using just Ford-Fulkerson 
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm)
    was going to be too slow for their test cases
    since this has complexity O(E*f), where E is the number of edges and f the maximum flow.
    I didn't try using Ford-Fulkerson, though. Maybe it would have worked.
    Instead I used Dinic's algorithm
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinic%27s_algorithm)
    after adding a single source and a single exit to the graph.
    This function computes the maximum flow on a graph using Dinic's algorithm.
    Numbering the vertices 0,1,...,n
        entrances = list of vertices from which the flow enters
        exits     = list of vertices from which the flow exits
        path      = Capacity (maximum flow per edge) matrix of size n x n.
    entrances and exits are supposed to be disjoint subsets of vertices.
    It assumes that the maximum flow is 2000000.
    The function returns the maximum total flow reaching exits.
